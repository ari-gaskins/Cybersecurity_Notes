# Cybersecurity Notes 

## Operating Systems Hardening
- ### Secure Installation: follow protocols, restricted sharing
	- ***Research:*** standards, information, knowledge, look for known vulnerabilities
	- ***Design:*** creating systems network
	- ***Configuration:*** OS, overall system hardware & software
	- ***Testing:*** before configuring system, must be separate from server ``localhost``
	- ***Implemention:*** after testing, put network online
	- ***Monitoring/Managing:*** updating, doing patches, looking for vulnerabilities
- ### OS Installion
	- configure OS in isolation
	- before connected to network/server
	- must have licensed updates and patches for vulnerabilities
- ### Vendor Sites 
	- show more information about system hardening
	- Microsoft Windows are best to read
- ### Security Agents
	- firewalls, anti-virus, etc.
- ### Secure Boot
	- checks OS software before computer is booted up using it
- ### Hash File
	- computer's fingerprint
- Fresh boot is typically less secure because it hasn't been hardened

- ### Removing Unnecessary Components
	- components of the box have everything, most isn't needed by the average user
	- third party companies like McAfee, Adobe, etc. add more to unnecessary components
	- more unnecessary components -> more vulnerabilities
	- built-in vulnerability scanners can help remove unnecessary components
	- removing can help or hurt OS; more or less efficient
- ### Practice Points
	- Active Directory
	- System Hardening
